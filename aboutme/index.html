    <h2>Eric Preszler</h2>
    <h2>Vincent</h2>
    <p>I am working towards my BS in applied technology with emphasis in programming. I love to read. I am divorced with 2 children ages 12 and 14. 
    I am full time caregiving for my father who has dementia and my mother who recently broke her hip. 
    I love being able to study online and having spirituality incorporated in every class. I have been a member of the church since being baptized when I was 8.</p>
